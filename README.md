# Peredis

The aim of this project is to recreate a Redis-like database, with a
persistent storage mechanism, applied after every transaction.

First tried in Ruby, now rewriting it in Go.

This is mainly an educational project. For fun.

If you use this in production, please be careful, and please let me know!
